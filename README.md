# Embedded Systems Class Repository

Welcome to my repository for the Embedded Systems class! In this course, I worked with the TI-CC3200, a 32-bit Arm Cortex-M4 Wi-FiÂ® wireless MCU, to complete various labs and projects related to embedded systems development. Below, you'll find information about the labs I completed during the course.

## Lab 2: Serial Interfacing Using SPI and I2C

In this lab, I used SPI to interface the CC3200 LaunchPad to a color OLED display. I also used I2C to communicate with an on-board Bosch BMA222 acceleration sensor. The application program will detect the XY tilt of the board based on BMA222 readings and use the tilt to control an icon on the OLED display. I also used a Saleae logic probe to capture and display SPI and I2C signal waveforms

## Lab 3: IR Remote Control Texting Over an Asynchronous Serial (UART) Link

In this lab, I used the Saleae logic analyzer and an IR receiver module to characterize the 
transmissions for buttons from an AT&T IR remote control for a specific TV. I was assigned a 
unique TV code so that each person was decoding different waveforms. I then interfaced the CC3200 
Launchpad to the IR receiver module and wrote a program that uses interrupts to monitor the signal from the IR 
receiver module. By analyzing the series of pulses, the program was able to determine which button was 
pressed on the IR remote control programmed for my particular TV code. I then used the IR remote
control to compose text messages using the multi-tap text entry system (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-tap) 
and send text messages back and forth between two CC3200 LaunchPad boards over an asynchronous serial 
(UART) communication channel.
